where e.g.
* `frame_track` | `frame__track` is a module that tailors a track to fit the frame.



Reverse dependency examples

* `walker` | `legged_frame` (universal, high traction, high stability, climbing angle skill magnitude of 45Â°) horizontal version, id est more than two legs
* `wheeler` | `wheeled_frame` (high speed mobile frame)
* `roller` (high traction, high pressure distribution, medium speed)

where e.g.
* `legged_frame` is a module that combines [frame_]legs, mobile frame resulting in a mobile base.
